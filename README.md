# Point_Plot-Traversal
An OpenCV based color detection and text detection task, through which a set of points on an image (refer attached image) are identified and a small robot (a point robot) traverses in the most optimal path which is PID controlled.

*> An image with red, blue and green dots is considered.

*> Task is to recognize the letter 'R' or 'G' or 'B' from the webcam using Pytesseract and make color decision for Red, Blue and Green respectively.

*> Based on the color chosen, dots on the attached image are recognised using OpenCV.

*> A tiny pink robot (point-bot) traverses through all the points of the chosen colour in the most Optimal path.

*> The path traversed is PID controlled.

*> Ant Colony Optimization is used in finding the optimal path.
